## Some (fine?) distinctions
 - A definition
 > "... a form in which particular features recur recognisably and regularly, if not identically or symmetrically." - p. 18 Ball, *Shapes*

 - this definition applies to what we might call:
     - natural patterns
     - decorative patters

 - A more generalised definition
 > "Something that recurs recognisably and regularly"
 - this definition captures what we might call "invisible patterns"
 - for example, we might talk about the "pattern of exploitative power in history"

 - Another definition (from software)
 > "a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem ..."
